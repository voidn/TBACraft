# TBACraft
Current Version: 0.0.4

This pack is distributed in two separate ways, you only need to download and use the one that applies to your launcher, or read the manifest and add the mods yourself. A few of them are clientside mods that I've included that you're free to remove or disable. I've included all of the server only mods so that single player instances will still mirror the multiplayer side.

## If you use Curseforge:
You'll want to download the "TBACraft.zip" and import it when creating a new profile in the Curseforge launcher.

## If you use Modrinth:
You'll want to download the "TBACraft.mrpack.zip" and "import from file" once you've unzipped it to show the individual "TBACraft.mrpack" file.



I've included the user readable modlist (without versions) with links to their respective repositories in the modlist.html
